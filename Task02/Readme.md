# Mobile First Landing Page

This deliverable is for a better understanding of designing web pages using the mobile first approach of writing CSS and responsive web UI using `@media` queries.

## Mind map 

Create a simple HTML layout -> start adding CSS according to the mobile view (Chrome Dev Tools for layout check) -> use `@media` query with `min-width` or `max-width` breakpoints of common screen sizes -> Use of `grid` for defining layouts

- Grid vs Flex
- Display none vs Visibility hidden
