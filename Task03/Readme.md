#  Simple quiz app

The quiz app focuses on manipulating the DOM(Document Object Model) using javascript to make our sites interactive. It follows a <b>Single Page Application(SPA)</b> architecture where only one html file is loaded on client side and all dynamic changes are handled using javascript and rendered in the same page.

## MindMap

Start Quiz button --> first question + next button --> next button --> save user selected option + render next question --> prev button enabled --> loop till last --> next button disabled + submit button added --> on Submit : Calculate Score by matching with correct options : Display Score.

Timer for each question starts at 59 --> clear timer on next button click
Interval to show clock every second --> clear interval on next button click
