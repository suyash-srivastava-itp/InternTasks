## Semantic Tags 

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a web page's structure. These tags provide information about the content they contain, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the purpose of the content. This improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall user experience.
